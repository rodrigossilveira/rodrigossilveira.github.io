## This is my portfolio site

Here I plan to showcase my most relevant projects and give easy access to my resum√© to people with little familiarity with github, mainly recruiters. 

It is also pretty cool to say to others that you have a site, don't you think?

I got a free template from [https:www.free-css.com](https://www.free-css.com) and edited it to my needs.
